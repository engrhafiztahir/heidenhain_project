I need the same functionality of Search Record button in ms access using a code. For example in Search Record button if I enter the equipment ID and press enter then relevant data is filled in all the fields and also if I want to add or edit the record I can do it. The same functionality I want using a code in ms access. If I enter the id I'm form and press enter then all the data must be filled. Remember I have an entry of Serial number which is auto filled. How to do it?

To replicate the "Search Record" button functionality in MS Access using VBA code, follow these steps:

Create a form with fields for the Equipment ID, Serial Number (auto-filled), and other relevant data fields.

Use VBA code in the AfterUpdate event of the Equipment ID field to search for the record and auto-fill the form fields with the relevant data.

Here’s a sample VBA code that you can use:

Steps:
In Design View, right-click the Equipment ID field and choose "Properties".
Go to the Events tab and select the AfterUpdate event.
Click on the three dots (...) to open the VBA editor and add the following code:
VBA Code Example:
vba
Copy code
Private Sub EquipmentID_AfterUpdate()

    Dim rs As Object
    Set rs = Me.RecordsetClone
    
    ' Find the record that matches the Equipment ID entered
    rs.FindFirst "[EquipmentID] = '" & Me!EquipmentID & "'"
    
    ' If a match is found, move to that record
    If Not rs.EOF Then
        Me.Bookmark = rs.Bookmark
    Else
        MsgBox "Record not found.", vbExclamation
        ' Optionally, clear fields if no record is found
        Me.SerialNumber = Null
        Me.Field1 = Null
        Me.Field2 = Null
        ' Add other fields as necessary
    End If

    ' If adding a new record, Serial Number will auto-fill if it's set to AutoNumber
    If Me.NewRecord Then
        ' Assuming SerialNumber is an AutoNumber field, MS Access will handle it automatically.
    End If

End Sub
Explanation:
FindFirst: Searches for the Equipment ID entered in the form.
Me.Bookmark: Moves the form to the matching record, auto-filling all fields.
If no record is found: A message box will pop up, and optional code will clear the fields.
Serial Number: If it's an AutoNumber, Access will automatically generate it for new records.
Allow Editing or Adding Records:
Ensure that the form's properties allow edits (AllowEdits), additions (AllowAdditions), and deletions (AllowDeletions) based on your requirements.
This should give you the desired functionality of searching, retrieving, and auto-filling records while also allowing for editing or adding new ones.

Can I add or edit data after the access auto filled all the data?

Yes, you can add or edit data after Access auto-fills the fields using the method I provided. The form will allow you to edit the data once it auto-fills from the matching record. Here’s how it works:

Auto-filling: When you enter the Equipment ID and press Enter, the form will auto-fill with the relevant data from the matched record.

Edit: Once the data is filled in, you can make changes to any field. Since Access has already loaded the record, you can modify the fields, and those changes will be saved to the database when you move to another record or explicitly save the form.

Add New Record: If no record is found for the entered Equipment ID (i.e., a new record), you can manually enter data, and the Serial Number will be auto-filled (if it's an AutoNumber field or follows a defined logic). You can add any additional data to other fields as needed.

Key settings to check:
Form Properties: Ensure that the form has AllowEdits and AllowAdditions set to Yes.
Binding Fields: Make sure that all fields are correctly bound to the table or query so that any edits will automatically update the database.
If you'd like to prevent editing after auto-filling or control it programmatically (e.g., allow editing in certain conditions), you can add additional logic to lock/unlock fields as needed.

Let me know if you'd like further customization!

But I want to save the record in the already defined auto serial number position. For example if I enter the 123 and press enter the previous auto filled serial number of 123 was suppose 10. Now when I press enter then in text box of auto serial number in ms access form the 10 should be displayed along with all other entries so that if I can modify the data so it will give no error. This is because each time when I click on add new record and type equipment id and press enter then ms access retrieve the data but display on a new auto serial number due to which duplicates has created and due to which it will not save data.

To resolve this issue where the Serial Number is auto-filled with the correct existing record’s serial number (rather than generating a new one and causing duplicates), you'll need to ensure that the record is being edited rather than a new record being created when a match is found.

Here's how to achieve that:

Updated Approach:
Prevent the form from adding a new record unless you want to.
Find the existing record based on the entered EquipmentID and ensure you're editing that record, not adding a new one.
Show the correct existing SerialNumber in the Serial Number field, so you're not creating a new AutoNumber.
Steps:
Use a Bound Form: Ensure that your form is bound to the table that includes both the EquipmentID and SerialNumber fields.
VBA Code Adjustment: Modify the AfterUpdate event of the EquipmentID field to fill in the existing SerialNumber and other fields instead of creating a new record.
Adjusted VBA Code Example:
vba
Copy code
Private Sub EquipmentID_AfterUpdate()

    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    Set rs = Me.RecordsetClone
    
    ' Search for the record that matches the Equipment ID entered
    rs.FindFirst "[EquipmentID] = '" & Me!EquipmentID & "'"
    
    ' If a match is found, move to that record and fill in the fields
    If Not rs.NoMatch Then
        Me.Bookmark = rs.Bookmark
        ' SerialNumber is auto-filled with the existing value
        Me!SerialNumber = rs!SerialNumber
    Else
        ' If no match is found, show a message and clear fields
        MsgBox "Record not found.", vbExclamation
        Me.EquipmentID = Null
        Me.SerialNumber = Null
        ' Clear other fields as needed
    End If

    ' Ensure you are editing the existing record, not creating a new one
    If Not Me.NewRecord Then
        Me.AllowAdditions = False  ' Disable adding new records unless explicitly allowed
    End If

End Sub
Explanation:
rs.FindFirst: Finds the record based on the EquipmentID entered.
Me.Bookmark = rs.Bookmark: Moves to the found record, ensuring you are editing that record.
Me!SerialNumber = rs!SerialNumber: Fills the SerialNumber textbox with the correct serial number from the existing record (this avoids the issue of creating a new serial number).
Disable Adding New Record: The form is set to edit the existing record rather than allowing a new one to be added with a new serial number. This avoids duplicate serial numbers.
Key Points:
Serial Number: The serial number will be fetched from the existing record when the Equipment ID is entered, ensuring no new serial number is generated unless explicitly adding a new record.
Edits Only: This method ensures you're editing an existing record, not adding a new one.
Disable New Record Creation: To prevent accidental creation of new records with incorrect serial numbers, the form’s AllowAdditions property can be disabled after the record is found.
This should prevent duplicate serial numbers and allow you to modify and save data in the correct record.
